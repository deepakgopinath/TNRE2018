}

\textbf{Response}

We thank the reviewer for this comment and we agree with him/her. We have rewritten the paragraph following his/her comments:  

\begin{quotation}\noindent
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an \newtext{unknown printer} took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s \newtext{the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages}, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
